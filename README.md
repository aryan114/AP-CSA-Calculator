# AP-CSA-Calculator-The-Coders-Period-1
Week 8:

Files to run: 

Pranav (Total: 18 + 5 = 23/25)

| Goals | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Improve the View aspect of the Login GUI (add color and make it look better). | Added color to all the JFrames instead of the regular grey look [https://github.com/aryan114/AP-CSA-Calculator-The-Coders-Period-1/blob/master/src/LoginToProject/Login.java#L24]. Added borders and highlights to some buttons. |
| Be able to consequently open the right panels in the right order (code the JFrames so that they open and close in the right order). | Panels open in correct order [https://github.com/aryan114/AP-CSA-Calculator-The-Coders-Period-1/blob/master/src/LoginToProject/Login.java#L59]. For example, NewUser panel opens up when Create a New Account button is clicked. Also, main menu opens up when user logs in. The sequential order of the panels is correct. |
| Get started on the code for the New User JFrame | I was able to get the credentials to store in a hashmap [https://github.com/aryan114/AP-CSA-Calculator-The-Coders-Period-1/blob/master/src/LoginToProject/NewUser.java#L47]. After talking Mr. M, I need to focus more on a MVC approach since current strategy doesn't work. Here is my start: [https://github.com/aryan114/AP-CSA-Calculator-The-Coders-Period-1/blob/master/src/LoginToProject/credstore.java#L12]. I will work on this more over the weekend and next week to get it working. My work is commented out as it doesn't work perfectly. |
| Since Iâ€™m not yet completely familiar with JFrame, my goal is to feel very confident with the swing this week | I feel much better with JFrames/Swing, proof is Login Panels [https://github.com/aryan114/AP-CSA-Calculator-The-Coders-Period-1/blob/master/src/LoginToProject/Login.java#L2]. I understand these much better, including creating them and using them through different commands. I was also able to customize the JPanel with new menu items. |

Self Scoring: My score for this week is a 18/20. I was able to achieve all my goals and I feel good about my work and learning this week.

Scrum Master score: Pranav's score is a 5/5 because he worked on the Login stuff and he achieved all of his goals. He still has more work to do on the Login project but he got a lot done this week.

| Finish the ecommerce website. This includes adding all the code to other buttons and potentially adding a cart feature for the user to see all the items they chose.| Made a Pythagoras calculator where the user inputs the two legs of their triangle and the hypotenuse is revealed. [https://github.com/aryan114/AP-CSA-Calculator-The-Coders-Period-1/blob/master/src/Pythagoras/Pythagoras.java#L3] |
| Finish the ecommerce website. This includes adding all the code to other buttons and potentially adding a cart feature for the user to see all the items they chose.| I added new colors to the Pythagoras JForm to make look better and more profressional. [https://github.com/aryan114/AP-CSA-Calculator-The-Coders-Period-1/blob/master/src/Pythagoras/Pythagoras.form#L1] |
| Finish the ecommerce website. This includes adding all the code to other buttons and potentially adding a cart feature for the user to see all the items they chose. | Helped Praveen with the e-commerce website, try to make it so when the user wants to see a new page, they press a button and the page pops up. Haven't finished this part yet, I'm just experimenting. But implemented an items class for later use. |

Self Scoring: My score for this week is a 18/20. I wasn't able to hit all of my goals from last week but I was able to make some progress on the ecommerce website and make the Pythagoras lab.

Scrum Master score: I give myself a 4/5 because I made some progress on the Ecommerce stuff and pythagoras lab but I felt like I could have done a little more.

Praveen (Total: )

| Goals | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Add more pages to the ecommerce website |I added the homepage to the ecommerce website as well as the main menu where you buy stuff from|
| Make a counter that says how much money is in your cart |I did not get this to work this week, but I will finish it by next week|
| Make all the pages functional |I made most of the pages functional, such as the home page as well as the page where items are being bought|
| Help out with any bugs that my group may have |I did help out with all the problems my group had, such as trouble commiting to github as well as adding comments and more functionality to Pranav's login code|

Self Scoring: My score for this week is a 18/20. I was not able to achive all the goals from this week, so I docked myself 2 points. I was able to help my teammates though and make good progress on the ecommerce website

Scrum Master Scoring: Praveen's score is a 5/5 because Praveen got a lot done in the Ecommerce project and also helped the others out. He helped resolve some GitHub issues and helped others with their code.

FILES TO RUN:
Main (for running the entire caluclator)
Login.java (this is not hooked up to the main menu yet, so run the Login file individually)
Please look at the CalculatorView form, it doesn't have any code behind it, just the display is the thing we will code over the weekend.

1. Ah ha participation 5 pts

2. Self grade. Show how you have engaged  in  your assignment.  Site an individual checkin, individual block of code that has your name in the data  5 pts

3. Scrum team grade. Let your code, readme, comments, and UI  do the talking for your project 15 pts

1. Pranav presented during the Aha presentation and talked about the JFrame. Our A Ha moment was our conceptual understanding of JPanels and JFrames. We understood that all the UI changes were made to the JPanel which was then added to the JFrame. The JFrame is kind of like the container which stores the JPanel and displays that.

2. Aryan - 4/5. This week I tried to experiment with BlueJ and also tried brainstorming several ideas for the new MVC Calculator GUI. However, I was not able to add the code to the new GUI form over the weekend and therefore I docked myself a point. I also was not able to get a diagram of the relationships between Model, View, Control in BlueJ. 

2. Pranav - 4/5. This week I spent a lot of time trying to understand MVC since this concept is pretty new for me. I outlined our ideas for the Calculator2 Project and how we could start it. In addition to understanding the fundamentals, I also worked on the Login UI. While this wasn't super complex, I just got started on it and I'm going to expand it over the next few days.

Praveen - 4/5. This week, I spent a lot of time learning about Jframe, and appying the concepts to code in GUI java. I am not used to this form factor, so I spent a lot of time reviewing youtube videos in order to familiarize myself with the project. I did a little bit of coding, with redirecting the login UI to the main menu, and also spent time on the GUI for my ecommerce website, adding the basic buttons and overall layout. I took off a point because I felt like I could have dome more in terms of code, rather than spend so much time researching.

3. 14/15 we gave ourselves this score because we couldn't work on implementing the code behind our new Calculator GUI. Also we didn't add any new funcitons to the calculator
this week.

What organization or reuse strategies will lead to minimizing Control and Model code?  MVC?

Model: The model aspect of the code is the overall structure of the code. In our calculator, our model could include the history and anything that "controls" the code. The background processes that take place are part of the model code. This could include setting the variables, changing the display, and etc. In an MVC project, the model code will not change as long as the purpose of the code remains the same. Since the model is the "theoretical" stuff behind the actual program, using the same model will allow us to reuse code. 

View: The code that is responsible for the visual aspect of the project - the GUI. This includes the colors, button placement, font, and etc. This code will stay the same since it just represents what the user sees. Different control and model code could be used under the same view code. So, applying those principles to our calculator, the view code is the code that creates all the buttons, gives them the colors, and defines the lables.

Control: The control code are the if/then statments that basically control the flow of the code. The control would change based on what we want our calculator to do. In a regular scientific calculator, our control code would just be the if/then statements that evaluate the operations based on the the operation clicked. However, in a binary converter, the control code would be the the code that converts the code from binary to decimal based and vice versa.


Our Plan for approaching the MVC Calculator: 

For our MVC calculator, we want to break up the code so that each component is in a separate file. The CalcUI would be a file which basically constructs the overall appearance of the calculator. This would include the JForm GUI Designe. Additionally, the code responsible for the model part is going to be in a separate file. Here, we will include code for storing the history, assigning the variables and what the program should do when certain things happen. The control code will be in a separate file and will serve as the linkage between the view components and the model components. This is how we plan on re-creating the calculator so that different parts of the code could be reused and recycled as needed.

Think about the View impact of coding to alternate platforms in todays computing world? 

The view part of the code is important because first of all, it sets the initial impression for the program. The better it looks, the higher the chances of the user looking/using the program. But from a coding point of view, the view part of MVC is important because it creates the layout for the OS that its being run on. While the view component might be changed in order to match the device/system that it runs on, the general model and control remain the same since the background operations are unchanged.

In our MVC calculator, we will need to change the view component in order to make the code run on both a console and a GUI. For the most part, we can keep the model and the controller code the same because the background operations will be the same. The only parts of the model that might change is the way the variables are stored or etc (since input is being typed, not clicked).
